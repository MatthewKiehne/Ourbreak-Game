# Ourbreak-Game
This is a fun little game I made for one of my classes. Infection spreads across the land. Cities are now being monitored by the CDC. The CDC is keeping a list of infected cities and applying an infection level to each city. Once the infection level rises high enough, a new city is created with the healthy that remain and the original city is placed in quarantine.
